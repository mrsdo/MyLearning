# 1). create the function


def greeting(name):
    print("Welcome, " + name)

# 2). Output = Welcome Christine
greeting("Christine")

# 3). Output = Welcome Sam
result = greeting("Sam")

# 4). Output = The function doesn't return anything... Why? The return value is stated in the result variable == None
#     There is nothing to return because the function 'greeting' doesnt' return anything.  Not sure why?

print("Expect results to have a value of: " + str(result))
