**NOTES FROM NICK**

1. Make sure to take advantage of "else if" statements in addition to "if" statements. 
There were points in the code where multiple conditions were being printed for a single number. 
To avoid this, use an "else if" for subsequent conditions to go back to the top of the loop.

 
2. Be sure that your conditional statements contain a comparison within them to check for a boolean value. 
Your last one lacked a comparison, and it was causing a certain condition to print to the console on almost every line.

 
Here are some exercises that should prepare you for the upcoming coding challenge:
- [Exercise 1: “Even or Odd” (Conditionals)](https://www.codewars.com/kata/even-or-odd/train/javascript)
- [Exercise 2: “Count the Monkeys!” (Loops and arrays)](https://www.codewars.com/kata/count-the-monkeys/train/javascript)
- [Exercise 3: “Rock Paper Scissors!” (Conditionals)](https://www.codewars.com/kata/rock-paper-scissors/train/javascript)
- [Exercise 4: “Opposites Attract” (Conditionals and modulo operator)](https://www.codewars.com/kata/opposites-attract/train/javascript)
- [Exercise 5: “Sum of positive” (Conditionals and loops)](https://www.codewars.com/kata/sum-of-positive/train/javascript)
